#+SEQ_TODO:  TODO(t) HOLD(h) DEPENDENCY(d) | DONE(D) SUSPENDED(s)

#+TITLE: Todos
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil
#+ARCHIVE: archived.org::


A custom sequence of TODO->DOING->DONE can be declared at the top of the doc. You need to put the cursor on that line and press Ctrl-c Ctrl-c to refresh the local setup. There's only two types of states separated by a pipe symbol (ongoing v/s. end-state)

Tasks (or entire subtrees) can be archived using =C-c C-x C-a=. This will put them in =<filename>.org_archive= or at the location specified manually using the =+ARCHIVE= directive.

** TODO First item on the list
*** SUSPENDED These can be nested as well, and the best thing is that you can't put the top-level item in an end-state unless all items underneath are also in an end state themselves.
** TODO Another thing to do
** TODO One last thing

* Another list
** TODO Have to do this as well

* More stuff
** TODO Due tomorrow
