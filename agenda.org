Use Ctrl-c Ctrl-s to set (a schedule) date on a TODO item. This indicates a start date of sorts.
Ctrl-c Ctrl-d can additionally be used to set a deadline.

Both these options opens up a calendar and a date can be selected (using Shift+arrow keys)

Use Ctrl-c [ to add the current file to the top of the agenda file list, otherwise you won't see anything in the agenda view.

Agenda can be viewed using SPC o a (in Doom emacs), and you can go back and forth in time using =[= and =]= keys.
There might not be a keyboard shortcut for every action in Doom emacs so click on the bottom right corner text (Major mode) and it will open up a menu that has several options.
